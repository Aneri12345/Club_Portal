# Club_Portal
This project aims to automate the tasks performed by the club's committee members.

For example, the club members would not have to create and circulate google forms for registration of an event.
The students will not have to enter the credentials each time. They will just have to click register button in order to get registered for the event.
The club members can post flyers for the upcoming events. Students can also view previous event(s) details for a particular club.
There will be automated reminder for the meeting as a mail.

To run the project, first clone the repository, then open the backend directory in the terminal: type npm install, then type nodemon in order to start the server.
Similarly, open frontend directory in terminal: type npm install, type npm start to run the project.
After this a new google tab will open with the project you can explore the website :)

PS - This project is not yet fully developed.
